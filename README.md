# WorldOfImagesAngular

This project is created to refresh my angular knowledge


Installation:
1. clone/download the repo
2. run 'npm install' in main folder of the app.
3. ng serve
4. browse lokalhost:4200

To run unit tests: ng test --code-coverage.


currently it is just front end. There is a fakebackend.

If i find time I will try to create real backend with .net core and try to write the same with react and vue.
